  The company experienced a significant data breach, compromising sensitive
  data. As a junior security team member, my role was to manage the incident
  lifecycle: identifying vulnerabilities, isolating and containing the breach,
  recovering compromised systems, and ensuring compliance with security
  frameworks to prevent future attacks.

### Step 1: Identifying Vulnerabilities

Using the Google Cloud Security Command Center, I reviewed vulnerability findings to locate the source of the breach. This step involved inspecting alerts and analyzing security risks affecting virtual machines and storage buckets.

Action Taken:

*   Accessed the Security Command Center.

*   Reviewed the list of vulnerabilities and prioritized high-risk issues.

Key Insight: Early detection of vulnerabilities provides a clear roadmap for remediation.

### Step 2: Isolating and Recovering Compromised Systems

Objective: Shut down the compromised virtual machine (VM) and create a secure replacement using a snapshot.

Action Taken:

*   Powered off the affected VM to prevent further unauthorized access.

*   Created a new VM from a snapshot, ensuring the new instance was clean and secure.

Importance: Isolating compromised systems limits the attack surface and prevents additional data leakage.

### Step 3: Securing Cloud Storage

The breach involved public access to a storage bucket. I revoked public access and enforced uniform bucket-level access controls to enhance security.

Action Taken:

*   Disabled public access to the affected bucket.

*   Enabled uniform bucket-level permissions for consistent access control.

Key Insight: Misconfigured storage permissions are a common vulnerability that attackers exploit.

### Step 4: Restricting Firewall Rules

Excessively open firewall ports can expose systems to unauthorized access. I tightened access by restricting the firewall rules to allow only necessary traffic.

Action Taken:

*   Reviewed the current firewall configuration.

*   Closed unnecessary open ports and applied least privilege access.

Importance: Proper firewall management is crucial for limiting potential attack vectors.

### Step 5: Verifying Remediation and Compliance

The final step was to ensure that all vulnerabilities were successfully remediated and that the system complied with security best practices.

Action Taken:

*   Ran a security report to confirm that vulnerabilities were addressed.

*   Checked compliance status using the Google Cloud Security tools.

Outcome: The system was verified as secure, with no remaining critical vulnerabilities.
